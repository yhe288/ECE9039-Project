Exploring Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Heart Disease through Machine Learning.  

## Abstract
Cardiovascular Heart Disease (CVD) is a major global public health concern that accounts for a significant number of deaths each year. Identifying the risk factors associated with CVD is crucial for developing preventative measures and early intervention strategies. In this report, we applied the Ensemble Method to combine three base models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) together to build an optimal predictive machine learning classification model to distinguish whether individuals have CDV or not, which helps analyze the relationship between various risk factors and the development of CVD. This model is trained using a comprehensive dataset of over 70,000 individuals, which includes demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. The developed model achieves the F1 score as 0.72814, Recall score as 0.69041, Precision score as 0.77023, and AUROC as 0.73608. The results of this study could have substantial impact for clinical practice, enabling the development of personalized preventative strategies for individuals at high risk of developing CVD.
